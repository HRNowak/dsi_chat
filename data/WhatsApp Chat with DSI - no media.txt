13/03/2020, 11:29 - Nan DSI: Maybe I'm being over the top but it doesn't seem fair on other people to ignore it
13/03/2020, 11:29 - Nan DSI: Anyway just wanted to say in case you notice anything as well
13/03/2020, 11:29 - Ki DSI: Thanks for the heads up

13/03/2020, 17:48 - Nan DSI: Mm well I sort of wish I hadn't gone to the pub last night now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ but better late than never I guess. I still feel mostly fine anyway...!
13/03/2020, 18:05 - Noah DSI: Symptoms are persistent cough plus temperature. If you don't have both you should be ok hopefully... think that's the latest guidance.
13/03/2020, 18:06 - Nan DSI: I think the latest is to stay home even if you just have the cough... But they're not testing anyone so it's all just bloody guesswork anyway
13/03/2020, 18:07 - Noah DSI: Good thing you checked! Not as if we were going in anyway I guess.

16/03/2020, 10:39 - Ki DSI: or just a summary overall?
16/03/2020, 10:40 - Max DSI: I'd do a proper breakdown of how everything works, the people checking your git are gonna be the ones that actually care about your code so they'll appreciate a more technical explanation I think
16/03/2020, 10:40 - James DSI: Imagine you're explaining the project to Ki from DSI13 who's doing a similar project and found yours on GitHub üòâ

24/03/2020, 20:22 - Ian DSI: Hey everyone.  I've just try to endorse everyone in this group I'm connected with on LinkedIn as "Highly Skilled " in Data Science but a few of you didn't have it listed as a skill I could endorse.  James and Nan come to mind. I figure it doesn't hurt having an old guy rave about all of you and I wouldn't be lying anyway! So please connect with me on LinkedIn if we're not already and post DS as a skill I can endorse you for. Stay healthy everyone!
24/03/2020, 20:23 - Paul DSI: Cheers Ian! V kind we will return the favour! You stay safe too!
24/03/2020, 22:05 - Isabella DSI: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 09:52 - Nan DSI: Thanks Ian, yeah I need to add that to my linkedin profile then! I think at the moment I've just got the ones they automatically gave me
25/03/2020, 09:52 - Nan DSI: Also: I think someone (Aaron?) mentioned having a daily stand up - anyone still into this? I've realised I'm the last few days that despite enjoying doing stuff by myself I am also actually a massive extrovert (who could possibly have guessed) and I'm not loving this thing of not having colleagues. I was thinking, a quick check in at 10am or 10.30 every day just to say what you're planning on working on that day?
25/03/2020, 09:55 - Niall DSI: I'm down for this. My whole routine is out of whack, so this might help
25/03/2020, 09:59 - Nan DSI: Cool, that's what I thought too. Niall I wonder if we could do it on the houseparty app? Zoom is better for proper meetings but I think for something quick/casual like this it might work better and people can drop in and out easily.
25/03/2020, 10:14 - Anna DSI: Yeah i would be keen
25/03/2020, 10:24 - Nan DSI: Brill - I've got 1-1 at 11am so focusing on that right now but could do a quick check in at lunch time (12.30?) today unless you'd rather skip - then 10am each day from tomorrow? Or we can start from tomorrow. Should be max ten minutes I reckon
25/03/2020, 10:29 - Niall DSI: Either is fine. Maybe tomorrow is best
25/03/2020, 10:30 - Nan DSI: Sure - 10am-10.10 tomorrow then and anyone can join :)
25/03/2020, 10:31 - Niall DSI: Great
25/03/2020, 10:32 - Paul DSI: Sounds good I‚Äôll join too
25/03/2020, 10:36 - Nan DSI: üëç
25/03/2020, 10:45 - Suman DSI: Sounds good, will join too

25/03/2020, 12:11 - Niall DSI: Thats one way to kill a dog

25/03/2020, 13:21 - Ian DSI: üëç
25/03/2020, 13:29 - Maria DSI: Sounds good... we‚Äôll try!
25/03/2020, 13:46 - Tanya DSI: Thank you for the initiative, I am in too!
25/03/2020, 14:07 - Nan DSI: Brill, thanks all :)
25/03/2020, 16:41 - Max DSI: I'm in too
25/03/2020, 17:19 - Nan DSI: great :) Also - my friend and I are having a virtual houseparty on friday night, with a live stream of music and a couple of different video conference rooms for chatting and dancing, so if anyone would like to join just friend me on FB and I'll add you to the event :)

25/03/2020, 23:17 - Charlie DSI: <Media omitted>

26/03/2020, 09:42 - Paul DSI: What time are we up? 10?
26/03/2020, 09:43 - James DSI: Oh sorry guys, I like the idea of the standup but I'll give it a miss for the next couple of days!
26/03/2020, 09:43 - James DSI: I miss all your faces tho üò≠
26/03/2020, 09:46 - Nan DSI: Yup I'm just out for a walk for a minute but be back by 10
26/03/2020, 09:47 - Nan DSI: You too!
26/03/2020, 17:32 - Nan DSI: Hey all... thanks for doing the stand up this morning, it actually really helped me. Also just wanted to add a couple of things.. Paul mentioned https://www.stillhiring.io/ which sounded useful
26/03/2020, 17:32 - Paul DSI: This am was great! Good to see you guys!
26/03/2020, 17:33 - Max DSI: Ooo how do I get involved?
26/03/2020, 17:33 - Nan DSI: Haha just thought to look at slack and you posted it on there, brill
26/03/2020, 17:33 - Nan DSI: Also - I didn't bring an animal but here she is!
26/03/2020, 17:33 - Nan DSI: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul DSI: Ha
26/03/2020, 17:34 - Nan DSI: Max, we did it on houseparty because its easier to drop in on!
26/03/2020, 17:34 - Nan DSI: If anyone can't get the app we could rethink but it worked well for a quick casual chat
26/03/2020, 17:34 - Max DSI: Ah cool
26/03/2020, 17:51 - Isabella DSI: Are we doing it daily Nan? x
26/03/2020, 17:53 - Nan DSI: Yes :) I will try to anyway, hopefully if I forget or can't for whatever reason whoever is on there at 10am can go ahead anyway
26/03/2020, 17:54 - Isabella DSI: Thanks üòä
26/03/2020, 17:55 - Nan DSI: I mean obviously I still managed to be late this morning even though it was my idea üòÇ
26/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul DSI: Pet stand up
26/03/2020, 17:56 - Nan DSI: Pets mandatory
26/03/2020, 17:57 - Maria DSI: I‚Äôm making sure the marker pens are hidden next time. I keep finding graffiti-ed furniture I missed!
26/03/2020, 17:58 - Nan DSI: üòÇ oh yeah forgot to say BYO pen as well as a pet!
26/03/2020, 18:05 - Max DSI: What if I don't have a pet

30/03/2020, 10:09 - Nan DSI: If you can download it you can add me on there I think with this link
https://houseparty.com/add/nanliza
30/03/2020, 10:10 - Nan DSI: Although I just realised it's ten past, no worries if everyone is too busy this morning, I was making a cup of tea and a few minutes went by!

Pub night!
31/03/2020, 09:43 - Nan DSI: Gonna be on HP in a bit for a stand up - although my wifi is increasingly dodgy...!
31/03/2020, 09:43 - Max DSI: I'll drop in and say hi, is it the same link as last time?
31/03/2020, 09:44 - Max DSI: Wait I have no idea how house party works
31/03/2020, 09:44 - Max DSI: I take it I have to add someone haha

31/03/2020, 11:13 - Nan DSI: No worries - I was just wary of spamming this chat every morning, you can assume I will be on there at 10am (assuming I'm not late - Monday I was as my kitchen clock had the wrong time!) but will add a message tomorrow as a reminder and if it gets annoying you can tell me.
31/03/2020, 11:16 - Tanya DSI: Oh, thanks a lot! I will keep it in mind üëç
